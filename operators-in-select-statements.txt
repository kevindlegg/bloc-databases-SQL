Exercises
Answer the following questions and submit the responses.

1. Write out a generic SELECT statement.
    SELECT * FROM table WHERE description like '%any description%';

2. Create a fun way to remember the order of operations in a SELECT statement, such as a mnemonic.
    - Sweaty
    - Feet
    - Will
    - Give
    - Horrible
    - Odors

    Corresponding to:
    - SELECT
    - FROM
    - WHERE
    - GROUP BY
    - HAVING
    - ORDER BY

3. Given this dogs table, write queries to select the following pieces of data:

    Intake teams typically guess the breed of shelter dogs, so the breed column may have multiple words (for example, "Labrador Collie mix").

    - Display the name, gender, and age of all dogs that are part Labrador.
        SELECT name, gender, age FROM dogs WHERE breed like '%labrador%';

    - Display the ids of all dogs that are under 1 year old.
        SELECT id FROM dogs WHERE age < 1;

    - Display the name and age of all dogs that are female and over 35lbs.
        SELECT name, age FROM dogs WHERE gender = 'F' and weight > 35;

    - Display all of the information about all dogs that are not Shepherd mixes.
        SELECT * FROM dogs WHERE breed NOT LIKE '%shepherd%';

    - Display the id, age, weight, and breed of all dogs that are either over 60lbs or Great Danes.
        SELECT id, age, weight, breed FROM dogs WHERE weight > 60 OR breed = 'great dane';

4. Given this cats table, what records are returned from these queries?

    - SELECT name, adoption_date FROM cats;
    | name     | adoption_date |
    |----------|---------------|
    | Mushi    | 2016-03-22    |
    | Seashell |               |
    | Azul     | 2016-04-17    |
    | Victoire | 2016-09-01    |
    | Nala     |               |

    - SELECT name, age FROM cats;
    | name     | age |
    |----------|-----|
    | Mushi    | 1   |
    | Seashell | 7   |
    | Azul     | 3   |
    | Victoire | 7   |
    | Nala     | 1   |

5. From the cats table, write queries to select the following pieces of data.
    - Display all the information about all of the available cats.
        SELECT * FROM cats;

    - Choose one cat of each age to show to potential adopters.
        SELECT DISTINCT ON (age) * FROM cats;

    - Find all of the names of the cats, so you don’t choose duplicate names for new cats.
        SELECT DISTINCT name FROM cats;

6. List each comparison operator and explain when you would use it. Include a real world example for each.
    - If you can’t list these from memory, do these flashcards until you can!
>   Greater than, used when comparing 2 values: select account charges over $100

<   Less than, used when comparing 2 values: select account charges under $50

=   Equal to, used when comparing 2 values: select a specific charge amount for an account

<=  Less than or equal to, used when comparing 2 values: select charges less than a dollar amount and include transactions with that dollar amount as well

>=  Greater than or equal to, used when comparing 2 values: select charges greater than a dollar amount and include transactions with that dollar amount as well

!=  Not equal to, used when comparing 2 values: select a charge that is not a specific dollar amount

<>  Greater than or less than, used when comparing 2 values: same as `!=` essentially

LIKE    Used to pattern match a string: selecting all houses on a street regardless of directional

BETWEEN Implemented like "a BETWEEN x AND y", this is equivalent to "a >= x AND a <= y": picking all children in a range of ages

IS DISTINCT FROM    Used as "expression IS DISTINCT FROM expression", this should be used in place of <> when one of the inputs could be null.: selecting invoices not paid today when the paid date is the only method of indicating whether the invoice is paid...if it's unpaid, there will be no value at all

IS TRUE / IS FALSE  Used in the format "expression IS TRUE" when the input could be null. Always returns either true or false.: identifying a suspect in a crime that meets a group of criteria

IS NULL Determines if the contents of a cell are null. Can be used in conjunction with "NOT": selecting or omitting a car that does or does not have air conditioning.

AND Requires both expressions to be true for the row to be returned.: picking a car that includes all of the criteria you desire

OR  Requires one of the expressions to be true for the row to be returned: picking a car that includes at least a portion of the criteria you desire

NOT Requires the expression to be false for the row to be returned: not sure how to explain this, but it basically negates positive selection criteria

7. From the cats table, what data is returned from these queries?
    - SELECT name FROM cats WHERE gender = ‘F’;
    | name     |
    |----------|
    | Seashell |
    | Nala     | 

    - SELECT name FROM cats WHERE age <> 3;
    | name     |
    |----------|
    | Mushi    |
    | Seashell |
    | Victoire |
    | Nala     | 

       
    - SELECT ID FROM cats WHERE name != ‘Mushi’ AND gender = ‘M’;
    | id |
    |----|
    | 3  |
    | 4  |
